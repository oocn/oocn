{"name":"oocn.github.io","tagline":"oocn","body":"# Poooooole\r\n\r\n*The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* tells the story of a lawyer investigating the connection of two persons, Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde. Chief among the novel's supporting cast is a man by the name of Mr. Poole, Dr. Jekyll's loyal butler.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPoole is the butler for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator. It's designed and developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example templates, pages, posts, and styles.\r\n\r\n![Poole](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/98681/1834359/71ae4048-73db-11e3-9a3c-df38eb170537.png)\r\n\r\nSee Poole in action with [the demo site](http://demo.getpoole.com).\r\n\r\nThere are currently two official themes built on Poole:\r\n\r\n* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)\r\n* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)\r\n\r\nIndividual theme feedback and bug reports should be submitted to the theme's individual repository.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contents\r\n\r\n- [Usage](#usage)\r\n- [Options](#options)\r\n  - [Rems, `font-size`, and scaling](#rems-font-size-and-scaling)\r\n- [Development](#development)\r\n- [Author](#author)\r\n- [License](#license)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### 1. Install Jekyll\r\n\r\nPoole is built for use with Jekyll, so naturally you'll need to install that. On Macs, it's rather straightforward:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ gem install jekyll\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Windows users:** Windows users have a bit more work to do, but luckily [@juthilo](https://github.com/juthilo) has your back with his [Run Jekyll on Windows](https://github.com/juthilo/run-jekyll-on-windows) guide.\r\n\r\nYou may also need to install Pygments, the Python syntax highlighter for code snippets that plays nicely with Jekyll. Read more about this [in the Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code_snippet_highlighting).\r\n\r\n### 2a. Quick start\r\n\r\nTo help anyone with any level of familiarity with Jekyll quickly get started, Poole includes everything you need for a basic Jekyll site. To that end, just download Poole and start up Jekyll.\r\n\r\n### 2b. Roll your own Jekyll site\r\n\r\nFolks wishing to use Jekyll's templates and styles can do so with a little bit of manual labor. Download Poole and then copy what you need (likely `_layouts/`, `*.html` files, `atom.xml` for RSS, and `public/` for CSS, JS, etc.).\r\n\r\n### 3. Running locally\r\n\r\nTo see your Jekyll site with Poole applied, start a Jekyll server. In Terminal, from `/Poole` (or whatever your Jekyll site's root directory is named):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ jekyll serve\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpen <http://localhost:4000> in your browser, and voil√†.\r\n\r\n### 4. Serving it up\r\n\r\nIf you host your code on GitHub, you can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to host your project.\r\n\r\n1. Fork this repo and switch to the `gh-pages` branch.\r\n2a. If you're [using a custom domain name](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages), modify the `CNAME` file to point to your new domain.\r\n2b. If you're not using a custom domain name, **modify the `baseurl` in `_config.yml`** to point to your GitHub Pages URL. Example: for a repo at `github.com/username/poole`, use `http://username.github.io/poole/`. **Be sure to include the trailing slash.**\r\n3. Done! Head to your GitHub Pages URL or custom domain.\r\n\r\nNo matter your production or hosting setup, be sure to verify the `baseurl` option file and `CNAME` settings. Not applying this correctly can mean broken styles on your site.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\nPoole includes some customizable options, typically applied via classes on the `<body>` element.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Rems, `font-size`, and scaling\r\n\r\nPoole is built almost entirely with `rem`s (instead of pixels). `rem`s are like `em`s, but instead of building on the immediate parent's `font-size`, they build on the root element, `<html>`.\r\n\r\nBy default, we use the following:\r\n\r\n```css\r\nhtml {\r\n  font-size: 16px;\r\n  line-height: 1.5;\r\n}\r\n@media (min-width: 38em) {\r\n  html {\r\n    font-size: 20px;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo easily scale your site's typography and components, simply customize the base `font-size`s here.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nPoole has two branches, but only one is used for active development.\r\n\r\n- `master` for development.  **All pull requests should be to submitted against `master`.**\r\n- `gh-pages` for our hosted site, which includes our analytics tracking code. **Please avoid using this branch.**\r\n\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\n**Mark Otto**\r\n- <https://github.com/mdo>\r\n- <https://twitter.com/mdo>\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nOpen sourced under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).\r\n\r\n<3\r\n","google":"UA-53584910-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
